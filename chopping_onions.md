# How to Chop an Onion  

**Tools Needed:**  
- Sharp chef’s knife  
- Cutting board  

**Instructions:**  

1. **Prepare the onion:**  
   - Cut off the stem end (not the root).  
   - Peel off the outer skin.  

2. **Halve the onion:**  
   - Slice the onion in half from top to root.  
   - Lay the flat side down for stability.  

3. **Make horizontal cuts:**  
   - Hold the onion steady with your non-cutting hand.  
   - Make 2–3 horizontal cuts towards the root, but do not cut all the way through.  

4. **Make vertical cuts:**  
   - Slice down vertically from the top, keeping the root intact.  

5. **Finish chopping:**  
   - Turn the onion and chop crosswise for even dice.  
   - Discard the root.  

**Tips:**  
- Keep fingers tucked in while chopping for safety.  
- Chill the onion before cutting to reduce eye irritation.  
- Use a sharp knife to avoid crushing the onion.
