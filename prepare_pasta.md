# How to Cook Pasta

**Ingredients:**
- 1 liter of water per 100g of pasta
- 10g salt per liter of water
- Pasta of your choice

**Instructions:**
1. **Boil the water:**  
   - Use a large pot to allow the pasta to move freely.
   - Bring the water to a rolling boil over high heat.

2. **Add salt:**  
   - Once boiling, add salt to the water. This enhances the flavor of the pasta.

3. **Add the pasta:**  
   - Stir immediately to prevent sticking.
   - Maintain a steady boil while cooking.

4. **Check for doneness:**  
   - Follow the package instructions for cooking time.
   - Taste a piece a minute before the suggested time to check for "al dente" (firm to the bite).

5. **Drain the pasta:**  
   - Use a colander to remove excess water.
   - Reserve some pasta water if needed for sauces.

6. **Serve immediately or mix with sauce:**  
   - Toss with sauce right away for better absorption.

**Tips:**
- Do not add oil to the boiling waterâ€”it prevents sauce from sticking to the pasta.
- Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.
- If not serving immediately, toss with a little olive oil to prevent clumping.
