# How to Cook Rice  

**Ingredients:**  
- 1 cup rice (white or brown)  
- 2 cups water (for white rice) or 2.5 cups (for brown rice)  
- ½ tsp salt (optional)  

**Instructions:**  

1. **Rinse the rice:**  
   - Place rice in a fine-mesh strainer and rinse under cold water.  
   - Continue rinsing until the water runs clear to remove excess starch.  

2. **Boil the water:**  
   - In a medium pot, bring the water to a boil over high heat.  

3. **Add the rice:**  
   - Stir in the rice and salt (if using).  
   - Reduce the heat to low and cover with a lid.  

4. **Simmer the rice:**  
   - White rice: Cook for 15–18 minutes.  
   - Brown rice: Cook for 40–45 minutes.  

5. **Let it rest:**  
   - Remove from heat and let the rice sit, covered, for 5 minutes.  

6. **Fluff and serve:**  
   - Use a fork to fluff the rice before serving.  

**Tips:**  
- Use a 1:1 ratio of rice to water for firmer rice.  
- Do not lift the lid while cooking to retain steam.  
- Try using broth instead of water for more flavor.
