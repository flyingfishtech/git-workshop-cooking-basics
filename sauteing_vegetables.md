# How to Sauté Vegetables  

**Ingredients:**  
- 1 tbsp oil (olive, vegetable, or butter)
- 1 cup vegetables (e.g., bell peppers, onions, zucchini)  
- Salt and pepper (to taste)  

**Instructions:**  

1. **Prepare the vegetables:**  
   - Wash and dry the vegetables.  
   - Cut them into uniform pieces for even cooking.  

2. **Heat the pan:**  
   - Place a pan over medium-high heat.  
   - Add the oil and let it heat until shimmering but not smoking.  

3. **Add the vegetables:**  
   - Start with harder vegetables like carrots and bell peppers.  
   - Add softer vegetables (like spinach) later to prevent overcooking.  

4. **Stir and cook:**  
   - Stir frequently for even cooking.  
   - Sauté until vegetables are tender but still slightly crisp (about 5–7 minutes).  

5. **Season and serve:**  
   - Add salt, pepper, or spices to taste.  
   - Serve immediately.  

**Tips:**  
- Use a wide pan to avoid overcrowding.  
- Add garlic or onions for extra flavor.  
- For a richer taste, finish with a splash of soy sauce or balsamic vinegar.
