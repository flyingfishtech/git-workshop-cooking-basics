# How to Make a Roux  

**Ingredients:**  
- 2 tbsp butter (or oil)  
- 2 tbsp all-purpose flour  

**Instructions:**  

1. **Heat the fat:**  
   - Place a pan over medium heat.  
   - Add the butter (or oil) and let it melt completely.  

2. **Add the flour:**  
   - Sprinkle in the flour while stirring constantly with a whisk or wooden spoon.  

3. **Cook the roux:**  
   - Stir continuously to prevent burning.  
   - Cook to the desired color:  
     - **White roux (1–2 minutes):** Used for béchamel sauce and creamy soups.  
     - **Blond roux (3–5 minutes):** Used for velouté sauce and light gravies.  
     - **Brown roux (10+ minutes):** Used for Cajun gumbo and rich sauces.  

4. **Use immediately or store:**  
   - If making a sauce, slowly whisk in liquid (broth, milk) to create a smooth mixture.  
   - Let cool and store in an airtight container for later use.  

**Tips:**  
- Keep stirring to avoid burning.  
- Use equal parts flour and fat for a balanced roux.  
- For a gluten-free roux, substitute flour with cornstarch or rice flour.
